--[ 00 - Introduction

The purpose of this article is to detail the research I have recently
conducted regarding a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability in Open5GS,
an open-source 5G core network implementation. This vulnerability
stems from improper state machine handling in the AMF (Access and
Mobility Management Function) module, which can lead to an AMF crash,
effectively rendering the entire 5G core network unavailable.

--[ 00.1 - Background

Open5GS is a widely used open-source implementation of the 5G core
network, extensively applied in academic research [1-2] related to
5G core network security and functionality. Additionally, commercial
entities like NewPlane leverage this project for production deployments [3].

The AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function) is a critical
component in Open5GS, responsible for user mobility management and
access control. A failure in this module disrupts the entire core
network, affecting all connected users.

Exploiting this vulnerability requires minimal technical expertise and
resources. An attacker can execute the attack using two legitimate User
Equipment (UE) devices, such as the open-source UERANSIM, without any
modifications to the UE or the crafting of NAS packets. By triggering
an abnormal state transition during a handover between two gNBs, the
attacker can cause an AMF crash, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).
This demonstrates the low complexity and high impact of the attack.

--[ 01 - Vulnerability Details
We suspect that the vulnerability is triggered when a UE initiates a **PDU Session Establishment**
request. If the AMF detects a **duplicate PDU Session ID**, it may enter an **undefined state**,
causing an exception in its state machine.

The error likely occurs in the **NAS message handling** or **PDU session management logic** of the AMF.

More details can be obtained from this link:https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/issues/3708

--[ 01.1 - Steps to reproduce
We use one UE and one gNB to simulate a scenario where the UE repeatedly connects and disconnects.
The core network is built from source using the official tutorial for Open5GS, and one gNB is started
with UERANSIM. The configuration uses the default settings, as follows:

open5gs-gnb.yaml:
linkIp: 127.0.0.1   # gNB's local IP address for Radio Link Simulation (Usually same with local IP)
ngapIp: 127.0.0.1   # gNB's local IP address for N2 Interface (Usually same with local IP)
gtpIp: 127.0.0.1    # gNB's local IP address for N3 Interface (Usually same with local IP)

open5gs-ue0.yaml
# List of gNB IP addresses for Radio Link Simulation
gnbSearchList:
  - 127.0.0.1
Next, run the script to simulate the UE randomly connecting and disconnecting repeatedly. The AMF will
receive a large number of registration and deregistration requests. After approximately 5 to 10 minutes,
the AMF will crash.

#!/bin/bash
while true; do
    sudo ./nr-ue -c ../config/open5gs-ue1.yaml > output.log 2>&1 &
    process_pid=$!


    sleep_time=$(awk -v seed="$RANDOM" 'BEGIN {srand(seed); print 0.6 + rand() * 0.9}')
    sleep "$sleep_time"

    kill $process_pid


    sleep_time=$(awk -v seed="$RANDOM" 'BEGIN {srand(seed); print 0.1 + rand() * 0.9}')
    sleep "$sleep_time"
done

We suspect that when the UE initiates a PDU Session Establishment request, the AMF detects a duplicated
PDU Session ID and encounters a state machine handling exception, eventually causing the AMF to crash.

--[ 02 - Vulnerability Impact

A vulnerability in Open5GS AMF allows an attacker to trigger a PDU Session ID conflict during UE registration
and deregistration. This conflict leads to an AMF crash due to improper state machine handling, ultimately
resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) that disrupts the entire 5G core network.

--[ 02.1 Impact on 5G Core Network Availability

The AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function) is a critical component of the **5G core network**, responsible
for **user authentication, mobility management, and session handling**. When the AMF crashes:
- **All currently connected UEs lose access** to the 5G network.
- **New UEs cannot register**, as the AMF is responsible for processing NAS messages.
- **All active PDU sessions become invalid**, leading to **loss of connectivity** for ongoing data transmissions.
- **The entire 5G core network is rendered inoperable** until the AMF process is restarted manually.

This means that **even a single attacker-controlled UE** can **disable the entire network** for all users.

--[ 02.2 Attack Complexity and Feasibility

This attack is **low complexity**, as it does not require:
âœ” **Any modifications to UE firmware or NAS message crafting.**
âœ” **Exploiting any authentication bypasses.**
âœ” **Specialized knowledge of Open5GS internals.**

Instead, it can be performed using **legitimate UE behavior** with an open-source **UERANSIM simulator**, making
it easy to execute by anyone with basic 5G simulation knowledge.

Key exploitation factors:
- **Requires only a standard UE and gNB setup** (e.g., UERANSIM + Open5GS).
- **No authentication or privileged access required.**
- **Repeatable attack** â€“ The AMF will **continue to crash** every time the sequence is re-executed.
- **Can be automated** â€“ A simple script (as shown in the previous section) can continuously disrupt the network.

Given these factors, the vulnerability presents a **serious risk** to **5G testbeds, research environments, and
potentially real-world deployments**.

--[ 02.3 Potential Real-World Impact Scenarios
ðŸš¨ Scenario: Impact on Commercial Deployments of Open5GS
Open5GS is not only widely used in academic research but also serves as the foundation for commercial 5G core
network solutions. Companies such as NewPlane leverage Open5GS to provide commercial 5G services. If this
vulnerability is exploited in a commercial deployment, the impact could include:

Service disruptions affecting enterprise customers and end users.
Operational downtime, requiring network operators to restart the AMF manually.
Increased maintenance costs due to repeated failures and necessary fixes.
This highlights the potential risks for businesses relying on Open5GS for private 5G solutions, network trials,
or commercial services.
